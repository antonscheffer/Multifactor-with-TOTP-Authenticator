# Multifactor-with-TOTP-Authenticator
A small Oracle APEX 23.2 app using a password as first, and TOTP as a second authenticaton factor. It also has functionality to handle forgotten or expired passwords. 
I created this app just for fun. Its is certainly not intended as a "best practice" or preferred way of doing it, it is more that I saw so many other implementations doing stuff in such a way from which I thought "I would do it different". So this application is just "my way".
